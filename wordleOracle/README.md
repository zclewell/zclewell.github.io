# Wordle Oracle
This page can be used to predict future Wordle answers (assuming the method in which they are selected does not change).

## How?
The reverse engineering was done by inspecting the main.js file found on the wordle website. The method for choosing the word of the day is done completely client-side and relies only on the current date.

## Notes
Days prior to June 19th 2021 don't work.
